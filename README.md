Data Processing & Visualization Project
1. Introduction
This project is developed using Python 3 and focuses on data processing, analysis, and 
visualization. The goal is to load datasets, process the data efficiently, and generate 
clear charts that provide meaningful insights.
The project uses widely-adopted Python libraries such as Pandas for data handling, 
Matplotlib for visualization, JSON for configuration management, and the OS module 
for file and directory operations.
2. Required Libraries
To run this project, the following libraries are required:
Python 3
Pandas – for loading and processing data
Matplotlib – for creating visualizations
JSON – for configuration handling
OS module – for managing files and directories
3. How to Run the Project
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code (or any Python IDE).
Open the terminal.
Run the main script : python main.py 
The generated charts will be saved automatically in the project directory.
4. Team Contributions
This project was developed collaboratively by two team members, with clear division of 
responsibilities:
Muhammad Hamza
Handled data loading and preparation
Managed CSV files and configuration setups
Nauman Ali
Developed data processing logic
Created visualizations and dashboard components
5. Version Control
GitHub was used for version control
Commits were made incrementally to track development progress
Individual contributions are reflected in the commit history
6. Coding Practices & Notes
The project emphasizes functional programming concepts, using map, filter, lambda, 
and comprehensions
Traditional loops are minimize
Code is modular, readable, and designed to be easily extendable
